# Tic-Tac-toe

A game that everyone loves to play (you gotta aggre on that ðŸ˜‰).

I have been learning C for a year and finally took a step and made my first ever (fun and playable game) TIC TAC TOE or Nots and Crosses if you're from Austrailia

## Note:
I am using the native windows library for this game (windows.h). So, if you're a windows user then enjoy the game or else I'll re-do the game again for different platforms (Mac and linux).

## How to run:
Running this game is super simple. Just Compile the "Main.c" file using "gcc Main.c -o Main" and run the "Main.exe" file. 

## How to play
The game receives input from your keyboard's keypad
It follows a layout something like this:

 7 | 8 | 9
------------
 4 | 5 | 6
------------
 1 | 2 | 3
 
So, pressing the keys 1-9 will put the X or O in their respective position. Player names are highlighted with blue background color to indicate the respective player's turn
It also has some other secret functions too 

## The secret functions

Pressing the keys SHIFT + X will close the game
Pressing the keys SHIFT + R will reset the (clears the board, and X begins the game).

## Features that'll come in future

There some features that will definitely add in the future 
1) An AI playing with the player
2) A main menu
3) Customizable player names (Note: In AI mode, the AI player will have a default name "Computer")
4) And an infinite mode where the game will display a score board show who lost and who won in each round.
