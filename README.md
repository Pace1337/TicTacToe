# Tic-Tac-toe

A game that everyone loves to play (you gotta agree on that üòâ).

I have been learning C for a year and finally took a step and made my first ever (fun and playable game) TIC TAC TOE or Nots and Crosses if you're from Australia

## Note:
I am using the native windows library for this game (windows.h). So, if you're a windows user then enjoy the game or else I'll re-do the game again for different platforms (Mac and linux).

## How to run:
Running this game is super simple. Just Compile the "Main.c" file using "gcc Main.c -o Main" and run the "Main.exe" file. 

## How to play
The game receives input from your keyboard's keypad
Following a layout something like this:

 # 7 | 8 | 9
 -----------
 # 4 | 5 | 6
 -----------
 # 1 | 2 | 3
 
So, pressing the keys 1-9 will put the X or O in their respective position. Player names are highlighted with blue background color to indicate the respective player's turn
It also has some other secret functions too 

## Some secret functions

Pressing the keys SHIFT + X will close the game
Pressing the keys SHIFT + R will reset the (clears the board, and X begins the game).

## Features that'll come in future

There some features that will definitely add in the future 
1) An AI playing with the player
2) A main menu
3) Customizable player names (Note: In AI mode, the AI player will have a default name "Computer")
4) And an Score mode where the game will display a score board showing who lost and who won in each round.
5) The original crossing out feature is not yet implemented üòÖ. Yeah, I know it sucks without it. But will do that too soon üòÅ.
